Those in psychological professions assume they can influence decisions made in the legal system by providing experimental evidence. This course examines the roles psychologists play in the legal system, the assumptions of both legal and psychological professional groups, and how these groups can complement one another.

This diversity is expressed in terms of the students? ages, cultural background, language, disability condition, socio-economic status, and other non-traditional profiles. The heterogeneity of this inclusive classroom and our new online reality brings with it the challenge to design courses that meet the objectives of the course or program while effectively responding to the needs of all learners. In order to meet these challenges, innovative approaches like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) are being implemented. Designing our courses using these strategies and techniques makes them more accessible to everyone, thus reducing the need for individual accommodations.

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
? Describe  the three principles of universal design for Learning (UDL)
? Identify effective teaching strategies and approaches for each principle

A central component and a real challenge faculty face when implementing active learning is how to make learner assessments equally active so that students experience continuity. In this workshop we will look at practical strategies that can help faculty develop assessments that promote deeper learning with a particular emphasis on collaborative exams (two-stage exams). A portion of the workshop will be spent working collaboratively on the planning and design of assessments for active learning. Participants are encouraged to bring along an existing assessment to work on as part of the re-envisioning process.

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals"

Students work in small groups made up from participants of all streams and critically evaluate an environmental issue using the
expertise of all participants. Examples could be the reclamation of a former mining site, plans for expansion of a landfill or plans for a new water treatment plant. Aspects evaluated include, but are not limited to, land use, impact on vegetation and biota, availability of critical chemical data (e.g., trace metals, water/runoff quality), impact on the
local population, etc.). The result is a detailed environmental assessment report prepared by students.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to continue to permeate various industries in years to come. In fact, according to a 2020 PWC study, 86 per cent of companies surveyed said that AI will become a ?mainstream technology? at their organization by 2021.

From the narrow AI applications embedded in your phone to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), you will learn to distinguish the subtleties of AI systems. Additionally, you will be able to characterize the types of existing models behind the applications, and analyze the human, data, and technological resources necessary to develop such systems. Last, but certainly not least, this course teaches you the limitations and ethical issues, including biases, that can exist in AI applications and how to detect them.  Throughout your studies, you will have an opportunity to see AI in action through use cases that showcase the adoption of AI in several industries. Your challenge will be to explore how you can use AI to help solve problems in your ev"

As AI systems continue to become more prevalent in daily life, it?s crucial to also understand the negative effects AI can have on society in the form of unfair outcomes, privacy intrusions, and more. Therefore, it?s imperative that you understand how to deploy AI systems that are ethical, safe and inclusive. 

This course will teach you how to identify ethical issues in AI systems, create and execute roadmaps, and engage with relevant multidisciplinary stakeholders to address those issues. Our action-oriented approach is designed to offer you practical advice and the confidence to implement ethical and responsible changes to your AI systems.

To help develop your skills in responsible AI, this course references publicly discussed cases involving unethical behaviour. It also touches on AI systems you likely interact with every day where ethical issues exist. In addition to learning the basics of responsible AI, this course will help you become a more informed citizen in an AI-driven world by work"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) doesn?t exist without data. In 2006, British mathematician Clive Humby said, ?Data is the new oil.? And data is the fuel that powers AI. However, having data is not enough, you need good data. But how can you identify quality data in the AI world? This course provides the answer. 

The first part of the course will help you identify good data, spot potential biases, and interpret graphs and other visualizations from data. The second part of the course will focus on the practical aspects of data for AI projects. This section will help you assess data requirements for AI projects, differentiate between various storage methods, and identify data sources. Upon completion of the course, you will grasp the single most important aspect of AI?data.

To help you develop data skills for AI, you will be exposed to case studies and other projects that resemble data-related situations AI professionals face daily. During these exercises, you will examine the different steps of the "
